           PHASES OF CHRISTIAN GROWTH II <br>
           August 30, 2023   <br><br></h3>
    <article class="columns">
        <p>
           "I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father." 1 John 2:13</p>
           
           <p>When John addressed the young men he talked about their revelation in the knowledge of dominion over the devil. That means Christians in this category have a mindset of their sonship responsibilities, their full rights and authority over sin, death, darkness, the devil and the world systems. They are not slipping in and out of sin but exercising dominion over all things.</p>
           
           <p>The Church of Corinth was populated by a majority of Christians in their infancy. That's why Paul wrote, "And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ." 1 Corinthians 3:1. In the next verse, He gave us a hint about the trait of Christians yet to outgrow childishness:
           
           "I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able."</p>
           
           <p>Paul's first and second letters to Corinth is to baby Christians. That's profound but it is the truth! Invariably, the contents of a letter reveals the level of the maturity of the immediate audience. Paul's letter to the Hebrews was for Little Children as well. Paul admonished them like He did the saints at Corinth, "For even though by this time you ought to be teaching others, you actually need someone to teach you over again the very first principles of God's Word. You have come to need milk, not solid food." Hebrews 5:12 AMPC</p>
          
           <p>In my view there were only two Churches that evolved fully into the phase of Young Men -the Church of the Thessalonians and Philippians. Paul talked about how Big both Churches were on love for God and the Brethren. The saints in Thessalonica were enduring grievous persecution at the time Paul wrote them. The Philippians were active workers for Christ who were fulfilling their calling in Him -they were teachers already. A Christian or Christian community that is big on love and on the call of God have left childish things behind them. Be that Christian!</p>
           <br>
           üôèPRAYER
           I receive the grace of Christ not in vain but to grow up into Him in all things. I manifest love actively and in patience I endure persecutions. I throw away Childish things. I focus on my high calling in Christ to God's glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Amen.

        <h3>Success Belongs To You <br>
            Sept. 14, 2023</h3>
<article class="columns">

<p>"And he began to seek God in the days of Zechariah who was teaching in visions of God. And whenever he sought Yahweh God made him have success." 2 Chronicles 26:5</p>

<p>It's a New Day again and you will be tempted to analyze and rationalize every decision with your mind, intellect & feelings like everyone else around you.</p>

<p>Here is a profound success secret -Seek God. Ask God's guidance on practically everything you need to do. Even if your job is to open the gate. Whether you are an experienced businessman or a certified employee, it's immaterial. You get God's help by asking God's help. Start any task or decision by saying something like this, "I don't know what to do without you God." It's a simple approach that commands profound results. Each you seek God you will prosper.</p>

<p>God is the same forevermore. Same thing He did with one He will replicate with anyone when the conditions and laws remains constant. Success doesn't belong anymore to Abraham, David or Uzzah than it belongs to you. Success belongs to all God's Children. God doesn't raise failures or and you are God's very Child. You have no excuse not to be outstanding and exceptionally smart. As long as you invite God into your daily tasks you must succeed.</p>

<p>Zechariah was King Uzzah's instructor and He used visions & interpretations of the Lord to instruct king Uzzah on what to do per time. It worked. Uzzah succeeded because of God's input in his affairs. Make business, marketing & corporate decisions from the position of the Spirit. Get a spiritual mentor along this line while you've aligned your Spirit on your inside to submit to the Spirit. Success belongs to who? Enjoy your morning.</p>

<h3>Sexually Entangled?</h3>
<article class="columns">
<p>"I know having sex before marriage is wrong especially when I am the Sisters Coordinator but I don't know who to turn to for help."  That's how we began a long conversation leading to her deliverance from addictive sexual habits. I met Denike after my ministration  (not real name) during her NYSC programme. I know what it feels like to have an erection or an urge for sex as a single person. Trust me I know and we all know how that feels like.</p>

<p>I was addicted to masturbation and pornography for many years, more than a decade. It's a tough battle especially when the internet and entertainment industry is full of erotic triggers that send you back where you promised yourself you don't want to go. My new year resolutions used to contain this words every cross over night, "I will stop masturbating this year." It never worked.</p>

<p>I feel deeply especially when I see how many people are going through the storm of secret sexual vices with no one to confide in. Talk less of getting the help they really need. Are you down on a sexual habit right now and you don't know who to talk to, I am here That's why God sent me to you. This burden have been going through my heart all day long. I will not judge you. I have never judge any of those I have helped through this route before. Allow me walk with you. Allow me hold your hands in mine in tears and prayers. You can trust me. I will not let the sheep Jesus died for to stray away. I love you. Turn towards me, I beg of you. The Spirit is calling and Christ is reaching out through me. Don't give in to guilt. God's grace is yours and that's enough.</p>

<p>You have to trust me on this. I will not betray your trust. I will not break your resolve to live above this sin. My hands are open. I have been there with ladies after an abortion. I have been there with brothers have fornication, it didn't change my love for them. It didn't change that they are still God's own people. I have been there with ladies who gave birth to child out of wedlock.</p>  

<p>If you are looking for help in this regards and you have been praying to God that He send you one, I am here. God is with you and I am standing with you my friend, my brother and sister. The Spirit' is willing. Shame is of the devil but great grace is now available to you. Connect with me. Let's talk. DM ME. You are specially loved my friend. I pray for your courage to resist the temptation of resistance. You are beloved.</p>
